# Genetic Algorithm for Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Using Deep Learning

This project aims to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a combination of Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Deep Learning techniques. The VRP is a combinatorial optimization problem that seeks the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles delivering goods to a set of locations.

## Introduction
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a fundamental challenge in logistics and transportation. It involves finding the optimal routes for multiple vehicles to service a set of customers with known demands, starting and ending at a depot. This project leverages Genetic Algorithms (GA) for optimization and Deep Learning for route prediction and enhancement.

## Features
- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation:** Utilizes selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism for route optimization.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle large datasets with multiple vehicles and locations.
- **Visualization:** Includes tools to visualize routes and optimization progress.
