## Genetic Algorithm Optimization Problems - VehicleRoutingProblem and Diet Recommender

1. **Evolutionary Inspiration**: Genetic algorithms mimic natural selection to solve optimization problems, evolving potential solutions over generations.

2. **Population-Based Approach**: They maintain a population of potential solutions (individuals) encoded as chromosomes, which are evaluated using a fitness function.

3. **Selection Mechanism**: Individuals with higher fitness scores have a higher probability of being selected for reproduction, ensuring better solutions propagate.

4. **Genetic Operators**: Crossover involves combining parts of two parent solutions to create new offspring, while mutation introduces random changes to maintain diversity.

5. **Iterative Improvement**: Through multiple generations, genetic algorithms iteratively apply selection, crossover, and mutation to improve the overall fitness of the population.

6. **Applications**: Widely used in optimization problems across various domains such as engineering design, scheduling, and machine learning due to their ability to explore large search spaces effectively.
